<h1>Product design portfolio</h1>

<p>I've had the pleasure of leading design teams, working with early stage startups and big enterprise companies around the world. Here are just a few.</p>

<div class="section">
	<h2>Mesosphere</h2>
	<p class="media"><a href="http://mesosphere.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/dcos2.jpg" alt="DCOS"></a></p>
	<p>I joined Mesosphere in 2015 where I manage the Product Design team. Responsible for my team, our projects, the user experience of our product (<a href="https://mesosphere.com/product/">DC/OS</a>) including the user interface, design system, CLI and user research.

	<h2>Mailgun by Rackspace</h2>
	<p class="media"><a href="http://mailgun.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mailgun-screenshots.jpg" alt="Mailgun"></a></p>

		<p>I joined Mailgun in 2013 as their Lead Product Designer, their first full-time design and front-end hire in a team of 10 engineers. Mailgun is an email service for developers, an API for sending and receiving email, with customers including GitHub, Stripe and Slack. After having gone through Y-Combinator the company was acquired by Rackspace.</p>

		<p>As designer my role involves looking after the user experience of <strong>all user-facing Mailgun properties</strong>, including the <a href="http://www.mailgun.com">marketing site</a>, <a href="https://mailgun.com/cp">control panel</a>, <a href="http://blog.mailgun.com">blog</a>, <a href="http://documentation.mailgun.com">developer docs</a>, <a href="http://help.mailgun.com">help center</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mailgun/transactional-email-templates">emails</a>.</p>

		<p class="media"><a href="http://mailgun.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mg11.jpg" alt="Mailgun"></a></p>

		<p>Being part of a small team enables me to be closely involved with marketing, support, and business development while assuming the product owner role for the projects I'm part of. The bulk of the dev stack that I work with at Mailgun includes Python, Flask, AngularJS and Sass/SCSS.</p>

	<h2>Open-source and GitHub</h2>
	<p>I've long been sharing tips and techniques on web design and development. In recent years I've taken to GitHub to share full projects and resources that I think other designers and developers will find useful.</p>
	<p>Working on <strong>developer tools</strong> like Runnable and Mailgun I've been inspired to open-source a lot of the stuff I work on, enabling others to make use of them but also contribute back or discuss implementation and best practices.</p>
	<p class="media"><a href="http://github.com/leemunroe"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/github.jpg" alt="GitHub"></a></p>
	<p>You can find a bunch of my projects on <a href="http://github.com/leemunroe">GitHub</a>, a lot of which are related to email design and development.</p>

	<h2>Codeshare</h2>
	<p><a href="http://codeshare.io"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/code.jpg" alt="CodeShare.io"></a></p>

		<p>Share code real time with other developers. I hacked together this code sharing tool <strong>using Firebase, Node.js and Express</strong>. The purpose of this project was to learn Node.js, which my team were using at the time, and it gave me a chance to experiment with the Firebase API and <strong>WebRTC</strong>.</p>

		<p>Copy/paste and share real-time code snippets with others. If you share the url with a friend they will see your code as you type it. As of 2015 Codeshare has 10,000 active monthly users.</p>

<section class="section">
	<h2>Flask</h2>
	<p><a href="http://flask.io"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/flask_home.jpg" alt="Flask"></a></p>

		<p>Create really simple and sharable to do lists with Flask. No sign up. Nothing to download. Just add tasks. A simple productivity tool for getting things done and sharing lists with friends. Featured in <a href="http://lifehacker.com/flask-creates-shareable-to-do-lists-on-the-fly-no-acco-510290685">LifeHacker here</a>.</p>

		<p>Flask is a side project that I designed and developed with Ruby on Rails. It started off as a weekend experiment to learn CoffeeScript. <strong>I now use it as a playground to experiment with new ideas</strong>, 3rd-party tools and keep my development skills up to scratch.</p>

		<p>I wrote a blog post about how you should always have a side project as an <a href="https://medium.com/@leemunroe/side-projects-are-your-playground-a8d1fec5379d">experimental playground</a>.</p>

	<h2>Runnable</h2>
	<p><a href="http://runnable.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/runnable.jpg" alt="Runnable"></a></p>

		<p>In 2012 I joined Runnable, based in Palo Alto, becoming a member of the <strong>founding team</strong> and sole designer. Runnable enables developers to run server-side code in the browser. No downloading, nothing to install, no registration, just run code.</p>

		<p>My daily activities included product discovery, prototyping, user research, interface design, front-end development, integration with Node.js and Javascript and working closely with the engineers and founder.</p>
		<p>As an early stage lean startup, I spent a lot of time <strong>running experiments</strong>, talking to users and making good use of tools like Mixpanel, Optimizely and Qualaroo to help us undertand our user base, validate assumptions and determine the product development roadmap, while tackling any design related tasks that needed done.</p>

	<h2>Kareo</h2>
	<p><a href="http://kareo.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kareo.jpg" alt="Kareo Homepage"></a></p>

		<p>Based in Irvine, Orange County CA, Kareo develop EHR and Practice Management software. I joined as their first design hire, then <strong>managed the UX Team</strong>, helping them transition from a desktop to web application, and introducing their first iOS app. The company grew from 40 to 200 people during that time.</p>

		<p>Daily activities included product discovery, customer research, prototyping, conducting usability tests, designing and marking up the UI, working closely with developers and product managers while managing and recruiting the UX team.</p>

		<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/twit1.jpg" alt="TwitAmore Viral"></p>
	</div>
	</div>

		<p class="clear">TwitAmore was a side project of mine that went live on Valentine's Day 2012. It's a gimmicky website that tells you who you love on Twitter. I used it as an experiment to improve my Ruby on Rails skills, along with Haml, Sass, using the Twitter API and it was my first project using Heroku as a host.</p>

		<p>Due to the tie in with Valentine's Day the site went viral and managed to get on the front page of <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/02/14/twit-amore/">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2013/02/14/having-a-bad-valentines-day-forget-that-and-ask-twitamore-who-you-love-most-on-twitter/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+TheNextWeb+(The+Next+Web+All+Stories)">The Next Web</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/twitamore_n_2689812.html">Huffington Post</a> among others. The site received over 1 million unique visitors in 2012.</p>

		<p>In 2014 <strong>I sold TwitAmore</strong> to online dating site Dayzee.</p>

	<h2>Lookaly</h2>

		<p>I <strong>co-founded Lookaly</strong> while completing my Masters. You could describe Lookaly as Yelp for Northern Ireland. As Co-Founder I was in charge of many things including design, product development, marketing, sales and business operations.</p>
		<p>The site was well received in Northern Ireland attracting over <strong>40,000 unique visitors per month</strong>, and the iPhone app earned us a DANI award in 2011.</p>
		<p>Due to increasing competition in this space we eventually closed Lookaly. It was a great experience building and shipping a product used by so many people. And it was a <strong>great learning experience, building and running a product</strong>. It educated me on the importance of not saying yes to every request, the importance of prioritising features and roadmap, and the importance of business development and building a sustainable business model.</p>

	<h2>The Big Word Project</h2>
		<p>While at University I teamed up with classmate Paddy Donnelly and created a website that let people buy words of the dictionary, priced at $1 per letter, and link them to their website.</p>
		<p>It was a viral success. We managed to sell over 7,500 words, with endorsements from the likes of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/02/27/big-word-project">John Gruber</a>, and it led to a feature article in <a href="http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-05/st_alpha">Wired magazine</a>, April 2008.</p>
